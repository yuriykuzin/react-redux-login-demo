<p>The original task is described here:</p>
https://github.com/geeksteam/VacancyFrontendTest

<h3>How to test</h3>

1. Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yuriykuzin/react-redux-login-demo.git
cd react-redux-login-demo
npm install
npm start
```
Please note that the mock server will start on a port 8080. 
Also it will use locally static server on a port 8082.

2. Open the page in your bowser (http://localhost:8080 or other link accordingly to settings in your system)

3. Try to enter wrong login/password: foo/bar

4. Try to enter valid login/password: User/Password

Have a nice testing!
